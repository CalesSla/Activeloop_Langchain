Rainfall also forms lakes on top of mountains due to their high altitude or location in regions with heavy precipitation rates like hurricanes, typhoons etcetera that creates water bodies in landscapes which are otherwise dry desert areas as well creating a beautiful and peaceful scenery for people enjoying the views."
